# Code for graphs corresponding to e-butterfly paper

## Figures needed:
1. Figure 1. 
  + Status: Draft
  + Data Source: data/submission-data.csv
  + Legend: average number of eButterfly checklists submitted per month since 2012 . Over 39,000 checklists have been gathered with 230,000 observations and 682 species within those checklists among 1,700 participants. Note the heavy usage during summer followed by much lower reports in winter months do to the phenology of butterfly species in the northern hemisphere.
  + Reference: Figure 1 in eBird's Biol Conserv paper, doi: [10.1016/j.biocon.2013.11.003](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2013.11.003) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713003820#f0005](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713003820#f0005)
2. Figure 2.
  + Status: Not started
  + Data Source: ...
  + Description: Heatmap for observations; will need to somehow translate point density into a heatmap. The figure will have two panels: (a) most common reported butterfly(s) (b) all observations.
3. Figure 3.
  + Status: Drafted, need to try different map with (1) Great Lakes same color as oceans and (2) state/province boundaries
  + Data Source: data/vanessa-atalanta-data.csv, modified from Fig3_data_Vanessa.xlsx (cleaned-up data from K. McFarland)
  + Legend: (a) Observations of the red admiral (Vanessa atalanta) reported to eButterfy on April 15, 2012 in northeast North America; (b) Observations of Vanessa atalanta reported to eButterfy on April 16, 2012; (c) Observations of Vanessa atalanta reported to eButterfy on April 17, 2012.
4. Figure 4.
  + Status: Not started
  + Data Source: data/danaus-plexippus-data.csv, modified from eB Can migrants 2012.xlsx
  + Description: Effectively same as Figure 3, but for months of May, June, and July 2012.
  + Legend: (a) Observations of the monarch (Danaus plexippus) reported to eButterfly across Canada in May; (b) Observations of the monarch (Danaus plexippus) reported to eButterfly across Canada in June; (c) Observations of the monarch (Danaus plexippus) reported to eButterfly across Canada in July. Note the movement of the distribution from east to west.
